## Requirements

[![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/akshatvg/FMIYC?logo=python&style=social)](https://github.com/akshatvg/)

The source code of this project is written in **`HTML/CSS/JS, Flask`**. So, you need to install `requirements.txt` to run this project.

## Instructions
```
$ git clone https://github.com/akshatvg/FMIYC
$ cd FMIYC
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: #
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: #
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
Default output format [None]: 
$ python3 app.py
```

## Why FMIYC?
Scrolling through Instagram or Facebook and came across a really funny or interesting clip from a movie or show?
Spend hours thinking about it but still canâ€™t find where the scene is from and now you cannot get the scene out of your head?
FMIYC helps you find the movie or show with a clean and user friendly UI where the user is just required to upload the video onto our website. Once uploaded, within a few minutes, we give the user the awaited name he/ she was waiting for!

## How to use FMIYC?
1. Upload the unknown video clip on FMIYC
2. Click on search
3. See the movie or show you were so confused about
4. Enjoy! It's that simple :heart_eyes:

## Technologies used:
1. HTML/CSS
2. Bootstrap
3. Flask
4. Python
5. AWS 
6. AWS Rekognition
7. Google APIs
8. Google Cloud Platform
9. Microsoft Azure

## Challenges we ran into
We started creating the web application with Flask since it's easier and faster to develop. We usually do this and then migrate to a Django application. This time it was tough to do that considering our excessive dependency on AWS. We made our Flask application easily executable instead.
